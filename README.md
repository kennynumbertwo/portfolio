## About

Welcome my professional web development portfolio!

I built this website with React, Next JS and TypeScript. I was set on designing every component and all CSS myself, without the help of any external libraries.
I really wanted to create a unique component for the projects section. I am really happy with how it turned out and and plan to push the component to it's repository and include a link in the porfolio for others to add to their projects.

The floating orbs in the background were meant to be static in my initial design. Once I started writing the code, I thought it would be fun for the user to realize they can interact with the background through the user interface. Clicking on the ? on the bottom right reveals a menu where a user can add orbs, stop new orbs from being created, delete all orbs from the page, or resume creating the orbs.
